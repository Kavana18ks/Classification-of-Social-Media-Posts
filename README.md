# Classification-of-Social-Media-Posts

The primary objective of this project is to develop an automated system for classifying social media posts into medical and non-medical categories, with further subdivision of medical posts
into specialties such as psychiatry, orthopedics, oncology, and cardiology. Leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the
project aims to efficiently handle unstructured data, enhancing information retrieval and decision-making processes in the healthcare sector.
